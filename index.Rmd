I am a (cross-cultural) social scientist interseted in researching on values, stereotype accommodation as well old age stereotypes and discrimination. More recently, I also research on methods-related issues. I hold degrees in Sociology, Social Sciences and Psychology from universities in Romania, the Netherlands and Germany respectively. Currently, I am a visiting scholar to prof. [Klaus Boehnke](https://www.jacobs-university.de/directory/kboehnke) at the department of Psychology and Methods, Jacobs University Bremen.

After eight years in Germany, I am excited to now possess double nationality, Romanian-German!

I believe in research and teaching which treat participating individuals as human beings who each has their own life story, individual trait characteristics and, most importantly, opportunities in life. 

I am still developing my academic profile so I kindly ask for your patience and constant interest in my current, ongoing as well future contributions.

Sincerely,

Dr. Adrian Stanciu
